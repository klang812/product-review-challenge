Create a command line app that will evaluate whether a list of prducts are approved by reviewers.

Input
- Reviewers
- Product name
- Approval

Output (in alphabetical order of Product)
- Product
- Approval (listed separately based on whether approved or rejected)

    i.e.
    Approved
    Product name          Approved

    Denied
    Product name          Rejected

    - To be approved it needs to be 100% Approved otherwise its Denied

Solution should be able to run (and if applicable, built) from the command line.  Use scripts and instructions for running application and tests.

1.  Want a real UI
2.  Provide help statements (-h --help)



1. Load a file from the command file (sample-input.txt)
2. Parse that file (sort by product)


G.C., keychain - approve
J.M., holographic t-shirt - approve
J.M., basket of kittens - reject
B.L., holographic t-shirt - approve
G.C., holographic t-shirt - approve
B.L., basket of kittens - approve
J.M., mug - approve
K.S., mug - reject
G.C., basket of kittens - reject

(K.S.,) (mug) (-) (reject)
file.entry[0]        
        file.entry[1]
() () ()          (file.entry[-1])

G.C., basket of kittens - reject
[0]   1      2  3       -2 -1

G.C., basket kittens - reject
0       1     2      -2  -1

$productApproval = {}

entries.each do |entry| 
  product = ""
  approval = entry[-1]
  for (i=1; i<=entry.length[-3]; i++)
    product += entry[i] + " " 
  end
  $productApproval[product.chomp] = approval 

  
end
puts $productApproval

allApprovals = [{mug=>approval}, {t-shirt=>reject}]
